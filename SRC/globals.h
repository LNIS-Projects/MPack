// Original VPACK variables (net, block, num_nets, ...) contains the initial netlist
// Validated versions of the variables (block_validated) contains the current netlist informations ( updated once each cluster is fully filled)
// Current versions of the variables (block_current) are the working copies of the variables (modified on the fly during the mapping process)
// Rollback versions of the variables are used to revert the previous state during the iterative mapping phase

// Netlist description data structures (initial numbers, numbers after mapping --> will increase with the packing process)
