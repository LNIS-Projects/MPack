Brief Instructions

Install: type make to compile

Run the mapper: ./mpack input.blif output_basename [options]

The input.blif is the input netlist whose logic elements are mapped on a simple primitive library (primitives.genlib)
output_basename is the basename for all the output files generated by the tool - ex: ./out will be used to generate ./out_formatted.blif, ...

Options:
-matrix_width int : Specify the width of the MCluster [1-5]
-matrix_depth int : Specify the width of the MCluster [1-5]

-global_clock on|off : Specify if the clocks are global or not
